  "Description_AI": "INTRODUCTION1 AL M SYRUP is a combination of Levocetirizine and Montelukast which belongs to the group of medicines called H1 receptor antagonists and Leukotriene receptor antagonists respectively. 1 AL M SYRUP is indicated for the treatment and prevention of allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria (allergic skin reaction with red raised itchy bumps on skin) and bronchial asthma in children aged between 2-5 years. Allergic rhinitis (also known as hay fever) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by inflammation of the inner lining of nose accompanied by nasal decongestion, repeated sneezing, wheezing or red, watery and itchy eyes. It is usually caused by allergens such as pollens, dust, mould or flakes of skin from certain animals and can occur seasonally or year-round. Bronchial asthma is a long-term medical condition in which the path of the airways becomes inflamed, narrow and swollen.

  "Description_AI": "Your child's medicine at a glance1-AL Total Syrup is commonly prescribed in children to treat symptoms such as runny nose, cough, sneezing, watery eyes, sore throat, body ache, and fever. These symptoms are usually associated with common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other respiratory tract conditions.Give 1-AL Total Syrup to your child by mouth with or without food. If your child develops a stomach upset, prefer giving it with food. Always remember that the dosing schedule provided by your child's doctor depends on the type of symptoms your child has, so make sure to follow the prescribed dose, time, and way strictly.Give 1-AL Total Syrup at a fixed time each day so that it gradually makes a place in your child's daily routine, which will help you to remember. If your child vomits within 30 minutes of taking this medicine give the same dose again. However, never repeat the dose if it's already time for the next dose. Your child may start to feel better within a week of regular dosing. However, you must continue giving the medicine to your child to finish the complete prescribed course as stopping it abruptly may worsen your child's condition.Some of the minor and temporary side effects that your child may experience while taking this medicine include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, rash, and headache. Usually, these episodes subside once your child's body adapts to the medicine. In case these side effects persist or become bothersome for your child, consult your child's doctor without any delay.Narrate your child's complete medical history to your child's doctor, including any ongoing medicine regime or history of any allergy, heart problem, blood disorder, birth defects, airway obstruction, lung anomaly, skin disorder, liver impairment, and kidney malfunction. This information is critical for dose alterations and for planning your child's overall treatment.",

MECOLYN PG CAPSULE is indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain in adults. Neuropathic pain is a chronic painful condition caused by damage or disease affecting the somatosensory (sense of touch) nervous system (such as lesion or disease of spinal cord and\/or brain). It can also be caused by prolonged diabetes mellitus, infectious diseases (such as HIV infection or leprosy), chemotherapy, auto-immune disease (Ex. Guillain-Barre syndrome) or by other metabolic dysfunctions. Symptoms include shooting, burning or stabbing pain, tingling and numbness, spontaneous pain (pain without stimulus) or pain caused by normal daily activities that are typically not painful (such as brushing your hair, being in cold temperatures or rubbing against something).

  "Cluster_Description": "INTRODUCTIONMECOLYN PG CAPSULE is a combination of Pregabalin and Methylcobalamin which belongs to the group of medicines called Anticonvulsants and Vitamin-B complex respectively. MECOLYN PG CAPSULE is indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain in adults. Neuropathic pain is a chronic painful condition caused by damage or disease affecting the somatosensory (sense of touch) nervous system (such as lesion or disease of spinal cord and\/or brain). It can also be caused by prolonged diabetes mellitus, infectious diseases (such as HIV infection or leprosy), chemotherapy, auto-immune disease (Ex. Guillain-Barre syndrome) or by other metabolic dysfunctions. Symptoms include shooting, burning or stabbing pain, tingling and numbness, spontaneous pain (pain without stimulus) or pain caused by normal daily activities that are typically not painful (such as brushing your hair, being in cold temperatures or rubbing against something). Do not stop taking MECOLYN PG CAPSULE without consulting your doctor as it could precipitate withdrawal symptoms such as headache, insomnia (lack of sleep), nausea, pain, diarrhea, flu syndrome, anxiety, nervousness, depression, convulsion, excessive sweating, dizziness and physical dependence. MECOLYN PG CAPSULE has high potential to cause addiction and therefore caution should be exercised among patients who already has a history of substance abuse. MECOLYN PG CAPSULE can cause suicidal ideation in some individuals and therefore appropriate treatment should be considered as soon as the signs emerge. MECOLYN PG CAPSULE is not recommended for use in pregnant or breastfeeding women unless advised by the doctor and in male patients who plan to father a child. Consult your doctor before taking MECOLYN PG CAPSULE. The most common side effects of taking MECOLYN PG CAPSULE are dizziness, sleepiness, headache, dry mouth, mood changes, fluid retention and weight gain. Consult your doctor if any of the side effects worsen. USES OF MECOLYN PG CAPSULE Treats neuropathic pain in adults HOW MECOLYN PG CAPSULE WORKSMECOLYN PG CAPSULE effectively alleviates the symptoms of various types of neuropathic pain, where methylcobalamin acts by rejuvenating the damaged neurons by improving the production of myelin (a substance that covers and protects the nerve fibers from damage) and pregabalin acts by interfering with various pain signals travelling through the damaged nerves and the brain, thus leading to a significant pain relief in various neuropathic pain states.

  "Cluster_Description": "INTRODUCTIONMECOLYN PG CAPSULE is a combination of Pregabalin and Methylcobalamin which belongs to the group of medicines called Anticonvulsants and Vitamin-B complex respectively. MECOLYN PG CAPSULE is indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain in adults. Neuropathic pain is a chronic painful condition caused by damage or disease affecting the somatosensory (sense of touch) nervous system (such as lesion or disease of spinal cord and\/or brain). It can also be caused by prolonged diabetes mellitus, infectious diseases (such as HIV infection or leprosy), chemotherapy, auto-immune disease (Ex. Guillain-Barre syndrome) or by other metabolic dysfunctions. Symptoms include shooting, burning or stabbing pain, tingling and numbness, spontaneous pain (pain without stimulus) or pain caused by normal daily activities that are typically not painful (such as brushing your hair, being in cold temperatures or rubbing against something). Do not stop taking MECOLYN PG CAPSULE without consulting your doctor as it could precipitate withdrawal symptoms such as headache, insomnia (lack of sleep), nausea, pain, diarrhea, flu syndrome, anxiety, nervousness, depression, convulsion, excessive sweating, dizziness and physical dependence. MECOLYN PG CAPSULE has high potential to cause addiction and therefore caution should be exercised among patients who already has a history of substance abuse. MECOLYN PG CAPSULE can cause suicidal ideation in some individuals and therefore appropriate treatment should be considered as soon as the signs emerge. MECOLYN PG CAPSULE is not recommended for use in pregnant or breastfeeding women unless advised by the doctor and in male patients who plan to father a child. Consult your doctor before taking MECOLYN PG CAPSULE. The most common side effects of taking MECOLYN PG CAPSULE are dizziness, sleepiness, headache, dry mouth, mood changes, fluid retention and weight gain. Consult your doctor if any of the side effects worsen. USES OF MECOLYN PG CAPSULE Treats neuropathic pain in adults HOW MECOLYN PG CAPSULE WORKSMECOLYN PG CAPSULE effectively alleviates the symptoms of various types of neuropathic pain, where methylcobalamin acts by rejuvenating the damaged neurons by improving the production of myelin (a substance that covers and protects the nerve fibers from damage) and pregabalin acts by interfering with various pain signals travelling through the damaged nerves and the brain, thus leading to a significant pain relief in various neuropathic pain states.

Methylcobalamin helps in production of red and white blood cells, and in maintenance of nerve cells, sheath and bone marrow. Pyridoxine hydrochloride helps provide essential nutrients to our body and improves overall health. Always take Mecomax Plus Tablet as advised by your doctor.

This effect helps in relieving nerve pain and lowers the risk of seizures.

MECOMIN NT TABLET is a combination of two drugs: Gabapentin and Nortriptyline. Gabapentin belongs to a class of drugs called anti-convulsants whereas Nortriptyline belongs to tricyclic antidepressants. Gabapentin works by binding to the specific site on voltage-gated calcium channels; this helps in relieving nerve pain and lowers the risk of seizures. On the other hand, Nortriptyline works by preventing the released chemical messenger in brains (serotonin and noradrenaline) from being reabsorbed back into the nerve cells (neuron) in the brain. As a result, it prolongs the effect of serotonin and noradrenaline in the brain and prevents the movement of pain signals in the brain.<\/p>\", 'key': 'MedicinalBenefits'}, {'title': 'Directions for Use', 'content': 'Take MECOMIN NT TABLET with or without food.

Usually, the body sends the pain signals when there is an injury, but with neuropathic pain, the pain is not triggered by an injury, the body unpromptedly sends the pain signals.

  "Description_AI": "Your child's medicine at a glanceMefsan 100mg Oral Suspension is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It helps to lower body temperature (fever) and reduce pain and inflammation (redness and swelling) both in infants and children. It works by blocking the action of a chemical messenger that is known to cause fever, pain, and inflammation.Adhere to the prescribed dose, time, and way while giving Mefsan 100mg Oral Suspension to your child. Give it orally before or after food, preferably at a fixed time. However, prefer giving it after meals as this will prevent the chance of developing an upset stomach. If your child vomits within 30 minutes of taking this medicine, give the same dose again. Avoid giving more than the recommended dose for fast relief as that may cause unwanted effects in your child.Your child may exhibit side effects like nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, heartburn, and diarrhea after taking this medicine. These side effects are temporary and are likely to subside once your child's body adapts to the medicine. In case they persist or become bothersome for your child, do consult your child's doctor on a priority basis.Before administering Mefsan 100mg Oral Suspension to your child, do inform the doctor if your child is allergic to any medicine or products, or has a history of any heart problems, birth defects, liver disease, kidney disease, lung disease, or bleeding disorder. This information is critical for dose alteration and helps in planning your child's overall treatment.",

This process, which increases the charcoal's adsorptive ability, allows it to expand into a porous surface capable of trapping a multitude of toxins and chemicals. While natural oil production is necessary for keeping our skin moisturized, glowing, and free of wrinkles, too much can be a problem. Oily skin can trap dirt and other impurities from the environment, which then sit on our skin and result in clogged poresâ€”especially if you aren't regularly exfoliating.Activated charcoal, again with its adsorptive quality, can bind to these impurities and excess oil, while gently loosening deeply-ingrained particles with its gritty texture.

It kills bacteria by preventing them from forming the bacterial protective covering (cell wall) which is needed for them to survive.Faq:Q.Is Merobit a strong antibiotic? Which infections does it treat?Merobit is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. This means that it is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It is used to treat infection affecting the lungs (pneumonia) and complicated infections of the urinary tract, abdomen, and skin and soft tissue infections. It also treats bacterial infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) and infections that occur during or after delivery.Q.Is Merobit effective against bacteria only? Can it be used for any type of bacterial infection?Yes, Merobit is effective against bacteria only but not all bacteria. It is not effective against virus or fungi. Merobit is effective against some bacteria which include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. viridans group, etc. Merobit should only be used to treat or prevent infections against which it is effective.Q.My cousin was receiving Merobit for severe skin infection when she had a fit and Merobit was stopped.

If the side effects bother you, tell your doctor immediately. The doctor will give you an alternative medicine. Serious side effects are very rare. In case you develop serious side effects, seek immediate medical advice.Q.Does it matter if I miss or stop Merobit?It is important that you do not stop the treatment without consulting your doctor. Stopping the treatment may bring back the infection or you may develop resistance to Merobit. The same applies if you are forgetful in taking the suggested doses. It is recommended that you do not miss doses. If you do, take the missed dose as soon as you can and take the next dose as planned so that you stick to the same overall daily dose.Medicine disease interaction:It is not known whether Mero SB Injection alters the ability to drive. Do not drive if you experience any symptoms that affect your ability to concentrate and react.",

It kills bacteria by preventing them from forming the bacterial protective covering (cell wall) which is needed for them to survive.Faq:Q.Is Merobit a strong antibiotic? Which infections does it treat?Merobit is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. This means that it is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It is used to treat infection affecting the lungs (pneumonia) and complicated infections of the urinary tract, abdomen, and skin and soft tissue infections. It also treats bacterial infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) and infections that occur during or after delivery.Q.Is Merobit effective against bacteria only? Can it be used for any type of bacterial infection?Yes, Merobit is effective against bacteria only but not all bacteria. It is not effective against virus or fungi. Merobit is effective against some bacteria which include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. viridans group, etc. Merobit should only be used to treat or prevent infections against which it is effective.Q.My cousin was receiving Merobit for severe skin infection when she had a fit and Merobit was stopped. Was the fit due to Merobit?Seizures or fits have been reported with the use of Merobit. However, fits are more likely to occur in patients with a history of seizures or a brain lesion (wound, ulcer, abscess, or tumor) or patients having bacterial meningitis or compromised kidney function.Q.For how long will I need to take Merobit?The length of the treatment will be decided by your doctor, depending on your general health, the type of infection you have and how well you respond to Merobit.Q.What if Merobit does not suit me?It is common to have minor side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and headache but generally these settle down. If the side effects bother you, tell your doctor immediately. The doctor will give you an alternative medicine. Serious side effects are very rare. In case you develop serious side effects, seek immediate medical advice.Q.Does it matter if I miss or stop Merobit?It is important that you do not stop the treatment without consulting your doctor. Stopping the treatment may bring back the infection or you may develop resistance to Merobit. The same applies if you are forgetful in taking the suggested doses. It is recommended that you do not miss doses. If you do, take the missed dose as soon as you can and take the next dose as planned so that you stick to the same overall daily dose.Medicine disease interaction:Mero 500mg Injection is generally considered safe to use during pregnancy. Animal studies have shown low or no adverse effects to the developing baby; however, there are limited human studies.",

Which infections does it treat?Merobit is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. This means that it is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It is used to treat infection affecting the lungs (pneumonia) and complicated infections of the urinary tract, abdomen, and skin and soft tissue infections. It also treats bacterial infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) and infections that occur during or after delivery.Q.Is Merobit effective against bacteria only? Can it be used for any type of bacterial infection?Yes, Merobit is effective against bacteria only but not all bacteria. It is not effective against virus or fungi. Merobit is effective against some bacteria which include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. viridans group, etc. Merobit should only be used to treat or prevent infections against which it is effective.Q.My cousin was receiving Merobit for severe skin infection when she had a fit and Merobit was stopped.

If the side effects bother you, tell your doctor immediately. The doctor will give you an alternative medicine. Serious side effects are very rare. In case you develop serious side effects, seek immediate medical advice.Q.Does it matter if I miss or stop Merobit?It is important that you do not stop the treatment without consulting your doctor. Stopping the treatment may bring back the infection or you may develop resistance to Merobit. The same applies if you are forgetful in taking the suggested doses. It is recommended that you do not miss doses. If you do, take the missed dose as soon as you can and take the next dose as planned so that you stick to the same overall daily dose.Medicine disease interaction:It is not known whether Mero 1g Injection alters the ability to drive. Do not drive if you experience any symptoms that affect your ability to concentrate and react.",

Which infections does it treat?Merobit is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. This means that it is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It is used to treat infection affecting the lungs (pneumonia) and complicated infections of the urinary tract, abdomen, and skin and soft tissue infections. It also treats bacterial infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) and infections that occur during or after delivery.Q.Is Merobit effective against bacteria only? Can it be used for any type of bacterial infection?Yes, Merobit is effective against bacteria only but not all bacteria. It is not effective against virus or fungi.

If the side effects bother you, tell your doctor immediately. The doctor will give you an alternative medicine. Serious side effects are very rare. In case you develop serious side effects, seek immediate medical advice.Q.Does it matter if I miss or stop Merobit?It is important that you do not stop the treatment without consulting your doctor. Stopping the treatment may bring back the infection or you may develop resistance to Merobit. The same applies if you are forgetful in taking the suggested doses. It is recommended that you do not miss doses. If you do, take the missed dose as soon as you can and take the next dose as planned so that you stick to the same overall daily dose.Medicine disease interaction:It is not known whether Mero 1g Injection alters the ability to drive.
